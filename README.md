### About This Repo

Chess is a two-player strategy game that is played on an 8x8 checkered board. 
Each player starts with 16 pieces, each of which is one of six unique classes. 
* King
* Queen
* Bishop
* Knight
* Rook
* Pawn

I found an image dataset on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/niteshfre/chessman-image-dataset

I thought it would be a fun learning experience to create a Deep Neural Net to handle the classification task of identifying which chess piece is in a photo. It has been a fruitful learning experience and introduction into Tensorflow and Keras for me. 

This Repo contains Python Notebooks to accomplish one of 2 tasks:

  1. Data Preprocessing
  2. Classification Neural Network

I do not go into a deep dive of the orginal dataset, but here's a link to another notebook where the author robustly explores the image dataset used here.
